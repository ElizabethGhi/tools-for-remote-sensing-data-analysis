The following script presents an example of the use of precipitation data (CHIRPS) of a study area (Mexico Basin) using Earth Engine and Google Colab. The exercise shows the use of  clipping tool with shapes and temporal aggregations to reduce the information from a dataset of satellite images to a monthly time series dataframe. To use it is necessary to enter your Earth Engine account credentials, as well as to replace the paths where your files will be placed (in case you want to download them).
